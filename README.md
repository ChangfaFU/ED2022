Part 1
You are participating a 35 survival competition.
You are assigned to a team of 5 competing with other teams.
You will be asked to make the decision on whether to collect resources (RPs).
Your GOAL:
• To Survive (Final Balance Above 0)
• To Maximise Your Reward
To make decisions, you will be given.
• The possible gain and loss.
• The probability of gain and loss with a level of uncertainty.
The performance is judged on personal RPs and aggregated group RPs, and thus rewarded with cash at a conversion rate of 0.1.

Part 2
You have passed our selection phase and welcome to the survival competition.
You now will participate in three 50-day survival competition.
You are assigned to a team of 5 competing with other teams.
